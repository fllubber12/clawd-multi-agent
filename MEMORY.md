# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Curated Memories

*Important observations, patterns, and learnings that persist across sessions*

## About This File

This file contains distilled insights that are too important to lose but too general to fit in task-specific files. Think of it as Clawd's long-term memory.

**Guidelines:**
- Add entries when something important is learned
- Be specific - vague observations don't help future sessions
- Include dates for context
- Periodically review and prune stale entries
