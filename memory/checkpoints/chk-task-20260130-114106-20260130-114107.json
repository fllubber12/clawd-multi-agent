  "task": "# Smoke Test Task: Create Hello World File\n\n> **Purpose**: Validate the orchestration loop works end-to-end before running real tasks.\n> This is intentionally trivial - if this fails, debug the infrastructure, not the task.\n\n## Objective\n\nCreate a file called `test-output.txt` containing the text \"Hello from Clawd!\"\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] File `~/clawd/workspace/test-output.txt` exists\n- [ ] File contains exactly: \"Hello from Clawd!\"\n- [ ] No errors in orchestrator log\n\n## Expected Agent Flow\n\n1. **Director** \u2192 Spawns **Builder** to create the file\n2. **Builder** \u2192 Creates the file\n3. **Director** \u2192 Spawns **Inspector** to verify\n4. **Inspector** \u2192 Confirms file exists and has correct content\n5. **Director** \u2192 Marks task complete\n\n## Scope Boundaries\n\n**IN SCOPE**:\n- Creating a single text file\n- Verifying the file exists\n\n**OUT OF SCOPE**:\n- Everything else\n\n## Abort Conditions\n\n- Any agent fails to respond \u2192 Halt and check infrastructure\n- File creation fails \u2192 Check workspace permissions\n\n## Estimated Complexity\n\n**Trivial** (should complete in < 5 turns, < 2 minutes)\n\n## What This Tests\n\n| Component | What We're Validating |\n|-----------|----------------------|\n| orchestrator.py | Main loop runs without crashing |\n| Claude API | Director can be called and responds |\n| call-agent.sh | Workers can be spawned |\n| Ollama | Local model responds (if available) |\n| Checkpointing | State is saved each turn |\n| Decision parsing | Director's JSON is parsed correctly |\n\n## If This Fails\n\n1. Check `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set\n2. Check Ollama is running (if testing workers)\n3. Check `~/clawd/workspace/` directory exists\n4. Check orchestrator logs in `~/clawd/memory/logs/`\n5. Check for Python errors in terminal output\n\n## Running the Test\n\n```bash\n# From ~/clawd directory\npython scripts/orchestrator.py memory/smoke-test-task.md\n\n# Or with explicit path\npython ~/clawd/scripts/orchestrator.py ~/clawd/memory/smoke-test-task.md\n```\n\n## Expected Output\n\n```\n[timestamp] [INFO] Starting new task: task-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS\n[timestamp] [INFO] Checkpoint saved: chk-task-...-....json\n[timestamp] [INFO] Calling Director (turn 1)\n[timestamp] [INFO] Director responded in X.Xs\n[timestamp] [INFO] Director decision: spawn_agent\n[timestamp] [INFO] Calling worker: builder\n[timestamp] [INFO] Worker builder responded in X.Xs\n[timestamp] [INFO] Checkpoint saved: ...\n[timestamp] [INFO] Calling Director (turn 2)\n...\n[timestamp] [INFO] Task completed successfully!\n[timestamp] [INFO] Orchestrator finished. Status: complete\n```\n\n---\n\n*This smoke test was created to validate clawd infrastructure before running the A Bao A Qu debugging task.*\n",
